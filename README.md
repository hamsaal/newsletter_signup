# newsletter_signup
Newletter Sign up is one of the first project which introduced me to the world of APIs. This project was part of the "Personal Project Making" of the Udemy's Web Development
course I undertook. I  owe  alot to the instructors and the community which helped to identify and clear the problems I encountered during this  project making. 
The API used in this node js based web application is of mailchimp marketing.
This newsletter sign up is a powerful tool for effective email markeing utilizing the modern practices of the javascript.
